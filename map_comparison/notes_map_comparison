Notes Map vs Unordered_map

> The final ordering of the map seems to be in order as expected.
The ordering of the unorder_map is not in order based on the 
name of the map since it will insert element in no certain order,
compare to the map.

> The data structure of the map is implemented by self-balancing
binary search tree while the unordered_map is implemented by 
hash table. The map takes O(log(n) for insertion and while 
unordered_map might take O(n) for the worst case.

> The load factor increases as the size of the items being inserted
are increasing the hash table has to resize itself because of the 
insertion of more items.
