Notes for Creating  std:vector

1. Using curly  parantheses. The result I got from running the parantheses was
as expected. The output was 10 5 since it construct the value itself inside the curly parantheses.

2. Using curly parantheses by initializing. The result were similar to the first one,
since it is doing the same thing as constructing the values inside the vector.

3. Using the parantheses. The result were different since this is constructing the 
elements of the vector. The result was printing 5 ten times. 

4. Using the parantheses by initializing. The was the only one that gave an error 
saying "conversion from 'int' to non-scalar type 'std::vector<int>' requested.  
The error indicates that the two data type are not compatible with each other.
